	For my preliminary work on my Google Summer of Code 2012 proposal to MINIX 3, I have chosen to work on NetBSD utilites in the bin/ and usr.bin/ folders. At this early stage, I have mainly focused on porting the utilities that require little or no changes to run on MINIX 3. I have also found several utilities with Makefile issues that are easily fixed, and a few utilities with minor bugs.

The working ports I have are in the bin/ usr.bin/ directories of this repository.
