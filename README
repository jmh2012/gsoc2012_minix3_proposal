	For my preliminary work on my Google Summer of Code 2012 proposal to MINIX 3, I have
chosen to work on NetBSD utilites in the bin/ folder and also a few from usr.bin/. I have worked at figuring out which
utilities could be ported to MINIX 3 with little or no effort, and which ones had unmet dependencies.
I also found several utilities with Makefile issues that are easily fixed, and a few utilities with minor bugs.
